In this example, we're using the .container-fluid class to create a full-width container, and then nesting a row and column inside it. By adding the custom CSS class .full-vh to both the container-fluid and row elements, we apply the height of 100vh (viewport height) to make them fill the entire vertical space.

The .col class in Bootstrap uses a 12-column grid system, so by default, the div inside the column will adjust its width accordingly. You can modify the column class to adjust the width as needed.

The custom CSS class .full-vh sets the height property to 100vh, which ensures that the div element stretches to the full viewport height.

Remember to include the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in the <head> and <body> sections of your HTML file respectively, as shown in the example.
