        <h2>SimplifyIT - AI Jira Ticket Automation Tool</h2>
        <div class="timeline-date">May 2024 â€“ Present</div>
        <p>During my tenure at General Motors, I participated in their company-wide hackathon and 
          completed a project that integrated a basic Flask backend with a straightforward UI designed 
          as a chat interface. The application utilized LLama3 chat and code models provided for the 
          hackathon.</p>
        <p>Users initiated conversations by specifying whether they intended to create a feature or a 
          defect ticket. The chatbot then generated a corresponding template beside the chat window 
          and proceeded to ask users questions to populate the template. Some of these questions included
          things like the application being worked on, instance of the application (cloud, on-prem, etc.) and after receiving responses
          to these questions, the codebase was queried and fed to the model to improve context and give the AI a look into how the code is written.
          Once both the chatbot and 
          user completed filling out the template, it appeared filled out on the screen. The user was 
          then prompted to click a "Finalize Ticket" button to create the ticket in the Jira dashboard. 
          The Bot would then create a file of tests cases to ensure the Feature/Defect was implemented correctly.
        
          The project won first overall and I was asked to make a production version integrated into Jira itself
